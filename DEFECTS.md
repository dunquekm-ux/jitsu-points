## DEF-001 — Copy join code button gives no feedback / silently fails

**Severity:** Medium  
**Screen:** FamilySetup — Step 3 (join code display)  
**Status:** ✅ Closed — Fixed in build 2026.05.24.3

**Steps to reproduce:**
1. Complete family setup through to Step 3
2. Tap the "📋 Copy" button
3. No visual confirmation; unclear if clipboard was written

**Root cause:**
`navigator.clipboard.writeText()` is called with `.catch(() => {})` — errors are silently swallowed and there is no success state. User has no feedback either way.

**Fix:**
Added `copied` boolean state. Button label switches to "✅ Copied!" for 2 seconds on success. On failure, falls back to `document.execCommand('copy')` via a hidden textarea (Safari fallback).

## DEF-002 — Scroll / touch gestures don't work on any screen

**Severity:** High  
**Screen:** All screens  
**Status:** ✅ Closed — Fixed in build 2026.05.24.3

**Steps to reproduce:**
1. Open app on mobile
2. Try to scroll any screen with content longer than the viewport

**Root cause:**
`app/src/index.css` is the default Vite scaffold CSS — it sets `#root { width: 1126px; min-height: 100svh; }` which is completely wrong for a full-screen mobile PWA. Because `#root` has no explicit height (only `min-height`), child screens using `height: 100%` resolve to `0` and overflow is clipped.

**Fix:**
Replaced `index.css` entirely with PWA-appropriate reset: `html, body, #root` all set to `height: 100%`, `overflow: hidden` (each screen manages its own scroll). Removed desktop-layout styles.

## DEF-003 — Parent mode has no way to connect Google Drive on first use

**Severity:** Medium  
**Screen:** ParentDashboard  
**Status:** ✅ Closed — Fixed in build 2026.05.24.3

**Steps to reproduce:**
1. Complete family setup without Google sign-in (local-only mode)
2. Enter Parent Mode
3. No option to connect Google Drive appears

**Root cause:**
The "Reconnect Drive" banner only renders when `status === 'unauthenticated'`. On a fresh install with no prior auth, auth `status` is `'idle'` — the banner condition is never true. No separate "Connect Drive" CTA exists for first-time setup.

**Fix:**
Extended the banner condition to also show when `status === 'idle'`. Changed banner copy to "Connect Google Drive" for idle state and "Drive sync paused — Reconnect" for unauthenticated state.

## DEF-004 — App crashes with React error #185 on child home screen

**Severity:** Critical  
**Screen:** HomeScreen (`/child/:childId`)  
**Status:** ✅ Closed — Fixed in build 2026.05.24.3

**Steps to reproduce:**
1. Load demo data
2. Tap a child avatar
3. App crashes: "Unexpected Application Error! Minified React error #185"

**Root cause:**
`HomeScreen.tsx` line 72 calls `navigate('/')` directly during render when `profile` is not found:
```tsx
if (!profile) {
  navigate('/');  // ← illegal: calling navigate during render
  return null;
}
```
Calling `navigate()` during render triggers a router state update, which causes a re-render, which calls `navigate()` again — infinite loop. React error #185 = "Maximum update depth exceeded."

**Fix:**
Moved the guard into a `useEffect`. Component returns the loading spinner while navigation is pending.

## DEF-005 — No way to retrieve join code after initial setup

**Severity:** Medium  
**Screen:** ParentDashboard  
**Status:** ✅ Closed — Fixed in build 2026.05.24.3

**Steps to reproduce:**
1. Complete family setup — join code shown once on Step 3
2. Navigate away or close the app
3. Need to add a second device later — no way to see the join code in the UI

**Root cause:**
`joinCode` was stored in `familyMeta` (IndexedDB) but never exposed in the Zustand `AppState` or displayed after onboarding. The only way to retrieve it was via browser DevTools → IndexedDB.

**Fix:**
- Added `joinCode: string` to `AppState` in `appStore.ts`, loaded alongside `familyName` in `load()`
- Added **Family & Join Code** section to `ParentDashboard` — shows family name, join code in a styled dashed box, and a copy button with "✅ Copied!" feedback
- Section only renders when `joinCode` is non-empty (hidden in demo / local-only mode)

## DEF-006 — React error #185 on child home screen (persists after DEF-004 fix)

**Severity:** Critical  
**Screen:** HomeScreen (`/child/:childId`)  
**Status:** ✅ Closed — Fixed in build 2026.05.25.15

**Steps to reproduce:**
1. Set up a real family (any method)
2. Tap a child avatar on the Profile Picker
3. App crashes: "Unexpected Application Error! Minified React error #185"

**Root cause:**
`HomeScreen.tsx` subscribed to the store using a selector that returns a new array reference on every call:
```tsx
const taskInstances = useAppStore((s) => selectTodaysTasks(s, childId ?? ''));
// selectTodaysTasks uses .filter() — always returns a new array reference
```
Zustand's `useSyncExternalStore` compares selector snapshots with `Object.is`. Since a new array is never `===` an old array, React saw the snapshot as constantly changing and kept scheduling re-renders → infinite loop → error #185.

DEF-004 fixed a separate but identical-looking crash (navigate during render). This is a different root cause that produced the same error code.

**Fix:**
Removed the selector-based subscription for `taskInstances`. Instead:
- Added `taskInstances` (as `allTaskInstances`) to the regular full-store destructure
- Filtered inline in the component body: `allTaskInstances.filter(i => i.childId === childId && i.date === todayISO())`
- Kept `selectChildPoints` and `selectChildLevel` as selectors — they return numbers (primitives), which are safe for `Object.is` comparison

## DEF-009 — Reward claiming silently does nothing

**Severity:** High  
**Screen:** RewardsScreen (`/child/:childId/rewards`)  
**Status:** ✅ Closed — Fixed in build 2026.05.25.3

**Steps to reproduce:**
1. Navigate to a child's Rewards Vault via the TabBar
2. Tap "Claim" on an affordable reward
3. Confirm dialog appears; tap "Yes, claim!"
4. Nothing happens — points are not deducted, no success animation

**Root cause:**
`redeemReward()` in `appStore.ts` guards with `if (!reward || !state.activeChildId) return`. `activeChildId` is set by `selectChild(childId)`, which is only called from `HomeScreen`'s `useEffect`. If the user navigates to `/rewards` via the TabBar (coming from HomeScreen, which DOES call `selectChild`), `activeChildId` is set and works. However if the user opens the app fresh to the rewards URL, or if the store state was reset, `activeChildId` is `null` and every claim silently bails out. Additionally, RewardsScreen never called `load()`, so fresh-navigation could also result in empty reward/points data.

**Fix:**
Added `useEffect` to `RewardsScreen` that calls both `load()` (if not yet loaded) and `selectChild(childId)` — mirroring the pattern already used in `HomeScreen`. This ensures `activeChildId` is always set before any redemption attempt.

## DEF-008 — Tasks cannot be selected / tapped on child home screen

**Severity:** High  
**Screen:** HomeScreen (`/child/:childId`), TaskDetailScreen  
**Status:** ✅ Closed — Fixed in build 2026.05.25.3

**Steps to reproduce:**
1. Navigate to a child's home screen
2. Tap any task card
3. Nothing happens (or the task detail screen flashes and immediately navigates back)

**Root cause — two compounding bugs:**

**Bug A — Only `available` tasks were tappable.**
`TaskCard` set `isClickable = instance.state === 'available'` and suppressed the `onClick` for all other states. Tasks in `locked`, `missed`, or `completed` state visually appeared as dead zones — tapping them did nothing. Users expected to be able to tap any task to see its details.

**Bug B — `navigate()` called during render in `TaskDetailScreen` (DEF-004 pattern).**
```tsx
if (!instance || !template || !schedule) {
  navigate(`/child/${childId}`);  // ← illegal: navigate during render
  return null;
}
```
This is the same bug fixed in `HomeScreen` as DEF-004. If triggered (e.g. data not yet loaded when the component mounts), it causes immediate navigation back, making it appear as though tapping a task does nothing.

**Bug C — `TaskCard` used a `div` with `onClick`.**
On some iOS versions, non-native-interactive elements (`div`) require `cursor: pointer` to receive click events inside scroll containers. While `.clickable { cursor: pointer }` was present, a native `<button>` is more reliable across all browsers and iOS versions.

**Fix:**
- `TaskCard.tsx` — Changed `div` to `<button type="button">`. Removed `isClickable` guard — all task states now navigate to TaskDetailScreen. Removed `.clickable` CSS class (replaced with direct `.card` styles).
- `TaskDetailScreen.tsx` — Moved `navigate()` to `useEffect` (same fix as DEF-004). Added `load()` guard in case the screen is opened without going through HomeScreen first. Loading state shown while data resolves.
- `StreakScreen.tsx`, `AchievementsScreen.tsx` — Added `load()` guard (preventive — same pattern).

## DEF-010 — Sync data loss: rewards (and other parent-created data) disappear after cross-device sync

**Severity:** High  
**Screen:** All — data integrity issue in sync engine  
**Status:** ✅ Closed — Fixed in build 2026.05.26.1

**Steps to reproduce:**
1. Create rewards (or tasks) on Device A (laptop)
2. Open app on Device B (phone) — sync runs
3. Device B correctly receives the new rewards ✓
4. Reopen app on Device A — rewards are gone ✗

**Root cause:**
The sync engine has two independent code paths that both write to Google Drive with no coordination between them:

- `sync()` — triggered by `triggerSync()` in HomeScreen/ParentDashboard. Does pull-then-push.
- `push()` — triggered by `schedulePush()`, a debounced fire-and-forget that runs 2 seconds after any mutation (task completion, etc.). **Does push only — no pull first.**

**The race condition (same device):**
1. A mutation fires on Device B (e.g. child completes a task). `schedulePush` schedules a push in 2 seconds. Device B's IndexedDB has 0 rewards at this point (never pulled from Drive).
2. Within those 2 seconds, `sync()` starts. It issues an HTTP GET to Drive (takes ~500ms).
3. The 2-second debounce fires while `sync()` is waiting on the HTTP response. `push()` reads Device B's stale IndexedDB (0 rewards) and writes it to Drive.
4. `sync()` gets its Drive response (has 2 rewards), seeds Device B's IndexedDB with 2 rewards.
5. `sync()` checks whether to push: `isDirty = false` (set by `push()` in step 3) → no push. Drive is left with 0 rewards from step 3.
6. Device A syncs, pulls from Drive, seeds 0 rewards → Device A loses its rewards.

**Additional contributing issues identified:**
1. `seedFromDriveFile` is fully destructive — it deletes any local entity not present in the Drive file. If Device B completes a task and that instance hasn't been pushed yet, and Device A pushes in the meantime, Device B's subsequent pull will delete the completed instance (child loses a completion).
2. `pointsEvents` are append-only by nature but are replaced in full on every seed — same risk as above.
3. `needsPush = freshMeta?.isDirty !== false` fires when `isDirty` is `undefined` (newly joined device), causing aggressive pushes of empty data on first sync.

**Analysis:**
Root cause is the sync algorithm design, not the Google Drive + single JSON choice. Drive is the right backend for the constraints. The algorithm needs to guarantee no device ever pushes without first incorporating Drive's latest state.

**Fix (implemented in build 2026.05.26.1):**
1. **Replaced `schedulePush`/`push()` with a debounced full sync** — `schedulePush` now calls `sync()` instead of `push()`. Every write to Drive is preceded by a pull. Eliminates blind writes entirely.
2. **Union-merge `pointsEvents` and `taskInstances` in `seedFromDriveFile`** — `pointsEvents` are never deleted locally (only Drive events we're missing are added). `taskInstances` prefer local `completed` over Drive's non-completed for the same instance id; local-only instances are preserved.
3. **Cancel pending sync timer at start of `sync()`** — `_cancelPendingPush()` is now called at the top of `sync()`, so an externally-triggered sync always supersedes any pending debounced timer.
4. **`isDirty = false` on device join** — already correct in `joinFamily`; confirmed no change needed.

## DEF-011 — Locally-created rewards/tasks lost when reconnecting Drive after auth expiry

**Severity:** High  
**Screen:** All — data integrity issue in sync engine  
**Status:** ✅ Closed — Fixed in build 2026.05.26.2

**Steps to reproduce:**
1. Set up family on Laptop (Google auth succeeds, Drive file created)
2. Create rewards on Laptop
3. Laptop auth expires before the rewards are pushed (sync never fires, or token lapses)
4. Phone opens and uses the app (child completes a task → phone pushes to Drive → `Drive.lastUpdated` advances past `T0`)
5. Laptop user notices "sync not set up" / reconnect banner → taps Reconnect
6. After reconnecting: sync triggers, laptop **pulls** from Drive (Drive is newer than `lastSyncedAt`) → `seedFromDriveFile` full-replaces rewards store → **0 rewards**. Push then sends 0-reward state to Drive.

**Root cause:**
The pull in step 6 is correct — Drive *is* genuinely newer (the phone pushed). But `seedFromDriveFile`'s full-replace strategy for structural data (rewards, tasks, profiles) treated Drive as the single source of truth even when the local device had unpushed data. The rewards existed only in the laptop's IndexedDB and had never reached Drive; the pull wiped them.

The guard in DEF-010 (union-merge for `pointsEvents` and `taskInstances`) did not cover structural stores.

**Fix (implemented in build 2026.05.26.2):**
`seedFromDriveFile` now accepts a `preserveLocalOrphans` flag. The sync engine reads `isDirty` from `syncMeta` *before* the pull and passes `preserveLocalOrphans: true` when the device has unpushed data.

- `preserveLocalOrphans = true` (dirty local): structural stores union-merge — Drive items upserted, local-only items kept. Local rewards/tasks/profiles not in Drive survive the pull and are included in the subsequent push.
- `preserveLocalOrphans = false` (clean local): full-replace — Drive is authoritative, parent-deleted items propagate. This is the safe path when everything local has already been pushed.

**Trade-off acknowledged:** When `preserveLocalOrphans = true`, a reward deleted on Device A (and pushed) will survive on a dirty Device B until Device B explicitly deletes it. This is acceptable for MVP — rare explicit deletes are less harmful than silent data loss on reconnect.

## DEF-007 — Scroll / swipe still not working on some screens

**Severity:** High  
**Screen:** ParentDashboard, TaskFormScreen, BonusComposer, DemeritComposer, ManageRewardsScreen, ManageKidsScreen  
**Status:** ✅ Closed — Fixed in build 2026.05.25.2

**Steps to reproduce:**
1. Open app on a real device
2. Navigate to any parent screen with content longer than the viewport
3. Content below the fold is not reachable by swipe/scroll gesture

**Root cause:**
Six screen CSS modules used `min-height: 100%` on `.screen` instead of `height: 100%; overflow: hidden`. With `min-height`, the `.screen` flex container grows to fit its content rather than being capped at the viewport height. As a result, the inner `.body { flex: 1; overflow-y: auto }` container also grew to fit its content — its height was never less than its content height, so `overflow-y: auto` never triggered. The effective scroll target was the browser viewport, but with `html, body { height: 100% }` there was no working scroll mechanism.

Additionally, TaskFormScreen, BonusComposer, DemeritComposer, ManageRewardsScreen, and ManageKidsScreen were missing `overflow-y: auto` on `.body` entirely — a second compounding bug.

`HomeScreen`, `RewardsScreen`, `StreakScreen`, and `AchievementsScreen` used the correct `height: 100%; overflow: hidden` pattern throughout and scrolled correctly; this is why DEF-007 appeared on some screens but not others.

**Fix:**
All six broken screens updated in their CSS modules:
- `.screen`: `min-height: 100%` → `height: 100%; overflow: hidden`
- `.body`: added `overflow-y: auto` (where missing)

Affected files:
- `app/src/features/parent/ParentDashboard.module.css`
- `app/src/features/tasks/TaskFormScreen.module.css`
- `app/src/features/parent/BonusComposer.module.css`
- `app/src/features/parent/DemeritComposer.module.css`
- `app/src/features/rewards/ManageRewardsScreen.module.css`
- `app/src/features/profiles/ManageKidsScreen.module.css`
