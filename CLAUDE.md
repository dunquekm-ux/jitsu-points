# Jitsu Points — Project Documentation

## What This Is

Jitsu Points is a **gamified responsibility and rewards app** for children ages 5–12. Parents create tasks and rewards; kids complete missions, earn points, and redeem prizes. Runs as a PWA — no app store, no backend server, data synced via Cloudflare Workers + D1.

---

## Current State

**Last build:** `2026.05.28.1` — All phases complete (0–7). CI/deploy pipeline fully operational. DEF-001–015 all closed (no open defects). Google Drive + OAuth replaced with Cloudflare Workers + D1. Multi-child task assignment (`assignedChildIds: string[]`). 17 ADRs. Rive mascot integration pending designer asset.

### Running the prototype

Open `index.html` directly in a browser. All JSX is inlined, React/Babel load from CDN. Internet required only for fonts and CDN scripts on first load.

---

## Stack

| Layer | Technology | Why |
|---|---|---|
| UI | **React PWA** | Prototype is already React; zero distribution cost; no $99/yr Apple fee |
| Local storage | **IndexedDB** (via `idb` wrapper) | On-device cache; app works fully offline |
| Cloud sync | **Cloudflare Workers + D1** | Free tier (100k req/day, 5 GB); no Google account required; credential-based auth |
| Auth | **Secret token** (32-byte random, `localStorage`) | Generated at family creation; never expires; no OAuth, no sign-in screen |
| State | **Zustand** | Sufficient for this scale; no extra framework needed |
| Animations | **CSS animations + Rive** | CSS for confetti/effects; Rive for Jitsu mascot state machine |
| Notifications | **Web Push API** | Built into browsers; works on Android fully; iOS 16.4+ when installed to home screen |
| Audio | **Web Audio API** | Built in; zero dependencies |

**No backend server (Workers is edge functions, not a server). No database subscription. No Google account required. Nothing to host beyond Cloudflare Pages + Workers (both free).**

---

## Data Architecture

### Two-layer storage

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│  IndexedDB  (on every device)       │  ← always read/write here
│  Full copy of family data           │  ← app works 100% offline
│  Queued changes when offline        │
└──────────────┬──────────────────────┘
               │  background sync
               │  (on app open + periodic + on change)
┌──────────────▼──────────────────────┐
│  Cloudflare Worker + D1             │  ← REST API; one JSON blob per family row
│  Single source of truth             │  ← ~few KB, free tier is enormous
│  Free on Cloudflare's infrastructure│
└─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Sync behaviour

- **App open** → pull latest from Worker → merge into IndexedDB
- **Data change** → write to IndexedDB immediately → push to Worker (debounced 2s)
- **No internet** → write to IndexedDB, flag as dirty → sync when connection returns
- **Conflict** → last-write-wins per field using timestamps (sufficient for a family app)

### The family record

One D1 row per family. The `data` column holds the full family JSON blob:

```json
{
  "familyId": "uuid",
  "familyName": "The Smiths",
  "joinCode": "TIGER-42",
  "lastUpdated": "2026-05-23T19:00:00Z",
  "profiles": [...],
  "taskTemplates": [...],
  "taskSchedules": [...],
  "taskInstances": [...],
  "rewards": [...],
  "pointsEvents": [...],
  "settings": {...}
}
```

---

## Auth Model

### Credential token — no Google required

Nobody sees a sign-in screen. Authentication is invisible.

**Token behaviour:**
- Family creation → Worker generates a random 32-byte `secret` → stored in `localStorage` as `jitsu-creds: { familyId, secret }`
- Every app open: `hydrate()` reads credentials instantly from `localStorage` → status `'connected'` immediately
- No expiry, no refresh, no OAuth dance
- Children interact only with IndexedDB — never blocked by any auth state

**When credentials are lost (rare):**

| Trigger | Action |
|---|---|
| Browser/PWA data cleared | Use "Reset / Switch family" → re-join with join code |
| New device | Enter join code → Worker returns credentials for that device |
| Intentional reset | "🔄 Reset / Switch family" button in Parent Dashboard → wipes IndexedDB + localStorage |

**Children are never affected.** They always read from the local IndexedDB cache.

### Multi-device join flow

1. Parent sets up on their phone — family created on Worker, credentials saved to `localStorage`
2. Join code generated (e.g. `TIGER-42`) — displayed at end of setup
3. On each additional device: open the PWA → "Join our family" → enter join code
4. Worker returns `familyId + secret + full family JSON` → device seeds its IndexedDB
5. Child just taps their avatar from then on — no auth, ever

---

## Onboarding Flow

### First-time parent setup (new family)

```
1. Open PWA → "Welcome to Jitsu Points"
2. Tap "Set up our family"
3. Enter family name + first child profile (name + avatar)
4. App creates family on Worker (instant, no sign-in)
5. View join code ("TIGER-42") — share with other devices
6. → Parent dashboard
```

### Adding a device (child's tablet, second parent)

```
1. Open PWA → "Welcome to Jitsu Points"
2. Tap "Join our family"
3. Enter join code
4. App fetches family data + credentials from Worker
5. → Profile picker (child taps their avatar)
```

### Subsequent opens (everyone)

```
Children:   tap avatar → straight into app  (reads IndexedDB, no auth)
Parents:    tap "Parent Mode" → straight in  (credentials already in localStorage)
```

---

## Decided: Open Questions

| # | Question | Decision |
|---|---|---|
| Auth/PIN | Do parents need a PIN to enter Parent Mode? | **No auth for now** — profile picker tap only; add later |
| Early completion | Global setting, per-task, or both? | **Per-task toggle**, disabled by default |
| Notification permissions | Ask contextually on first task save with reminder set | See Notifications section |
| Selfie auto-delete | Who controls the 24h auto-delete toggle? | **Deferred** — decide when selfie feature is built |

---

## Constraints — Never Violate

- **Zero infrastructure cost** — no servers, no paid APIs; data lives in family's own Google Drive
- **Children never blocked by auth** — IndexedDB cache means the app always works
- **No PII transmitted** — names/data go only to the family's own Worker/D1; no third-party analytics
- **No level/XP decrease** — current points can go down; lifetime XP and level never do
- **Child safety first** — demerits must feel calm and corrective, never shaming

---

## Data Models

### ChildProfile
```json
{
  "id": "uuid",
  "name": "Emma",
  "avatar": "speed_hero",
  "level": 4,
  "currentStreak": 12
}
```
> Points are never stored on the profile directly — always derived from `pointsEvents`.

### TaskTemplate
```json
{
  "id": "uuid",
  "title": "Brush Teeth",
  "icon": "🦷",
  "points": 5,
  "allowEarlyCompletion": false,
  "requiresPhoto": false,
  "assignedChildIds": ["child_uuid_1", "child_uuid_2"]
}
```
> `assignedChildIds` is an array — one task can be assigned to multiple children simultaneously. One `TaskInstance` is generated per child per schedule per day.

### TaskSchedule
One template generates multiple scheduled instances (e.g. "Brush Teeth – Morning" and "Brush Teeth – Evening").
```json
{
  "id": "uuid",
  "taskTemplateId": "uuid",
  "label": "Morning",
  "startTime": "07:00",
  "endTime": "09:00",
  "reminderTime": "06:45",
  "recurrence": { "type": "daily" }
}
```

### TaskInstance
Generated daily per schedule. Stores per-day completion state.
```json
{
  "id": "uuid",
  "templateId": "uuid",
  "scheduleId": "uuid",
  "childId": "uuid",
  "date": "2026-05-23",
  "state": "available",
  "completedAt": null,
  "selfiePhotoPath": null
}
```

### PointsEvent
Every change to points — never mutate a balance directly. Current points = sum of events.
```json
{
  "id": "uuid",
  "childId": "uuid",
  "delta": 15,
  "type": "task",
  "sourceId": "taskInstanceId",
  "note": null,
  "timestamp": "2026-05-23T09:14:00Z"
}
```
`type` is one of: `task` | `reward` | `bonus` | `demerit`

### Reward
```json
{
  "id": "uuid",
  "title": "Ice Cream",
  "cost": 100,
  "enabled": true
}
```

---

## Points System Rules

| System | Purpose | Can Decrease? |
|---|---|---|
| Current Points | `pointsEvents.sum(delta)` for this child | **Yes** (redeem, demerit) |
| Lifetime XP | `pointsEvents.filter(delta > 0).sum(delta)` | **Never** |
| Level | Derived from lifetime XP thresholds | **Never** |

Demerits capped at **−20 pts**. Can only reduce current points, never XP or level.

---

## Task States

| State | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `locked` | Time window hasn't opened yet |
| `available` | Ready to complete |
| `completed` | Done for this instance |
| `missed` | Window expired without completion |

**State transitions run on app open and on foreground resume** — no background processing needed. The app recalculates every task instance's correct state from the current time on every open. This is the correct approach for a family app at this scale.

Early completion is **disabled by default** — parent can enable it **per task**.

---

## Key Workflows

### Child: Complete a task
Profile picker → tap avatar → Home → tap available mission → tap **COMPLETE** → confetti + points animation → (optional) victory selfie → back to home

### Child: Claim a reward
Rewards Vault → tap affordable reward → confirm screen → deduct current points → celebration

### Parent: Create a task
Parent Mode → New Task → name + points + schedule slots + reminder times → Save

### Parent: Add bonus
Parent Mode → Give Bonus → amount + reason → Save → child sees excitement popup (+points)

### Parent: Add demerit
Parent Mode → Check-in → amount (capped −20) + reason → Save → child sees calm correction popup

---

## Notifications

Web Push API — entirely on-device, no push server required for local notifications.

**Permission timing:** ask when parent saves a task with a reminder time set. Reason is obvious in that moment.

**iOS:** requires PWA to be installed to home screen (Add to Home Screen). Web push on iOS works from Safari 16.4+.

**Notification payload:**
```js
// Task reminder
{ title: '🦷 Jitsu Mission Ready!', body: 'Brush your teeth for +5 points!' }

// Bonus
{ title: '🎉 Surprise bonus from Mom!', body: '+25 points — check the app!' }
```

**After reboot:** re-schedule all pending notifications on app open by reading task schedules from IndexedDB.

---

## Design System (from prototype)

- **Fonts:** Fredoka (display/headings) + Nunito (body) — Google Fonts
- **Default palette (Candy):** hot pink `#FF4F8B` / sunny yellow `#FFD23F` / mint `#3BCEAC` / sky `#4DA8FF` on cream `#FFF6E8`
- **Themes:** Candy (default), Berry, Ocean, Sunset — defined in `tokens.jsx`
- **Shape language:** large border radii (10–28px), chunky 4–6px offset drop shadows
- **Mascot:** "Jitsu" — geometric ninja, 5 moods: `happy`, `wow`, `calm`, `sleep`, `cheer` → implement in Rive
- **Avatar system:** 6 options (Speed Hero, Water Pup, Leaf Ninja, Flame Fox, Star Kid, Moon Cub)

**Nice to have:** Notifications, Selfies, Achievements/badges, Streaks, Unlockable cosmetics

---

## Build Plan

### Guiding Principles

1. **Build number every commit** — format `YYYY.MM.DD.N`. Visible in UI (bottom corner tooltip). Logged in `CHANGELOG.md`.
2. **Domain first** — `src/domain/` is pure TypeScript. Zero React. Zero browser APIs. Fully unit-testable.
3. **CSS custom properties only** — no raw hex or magic numbers in components. All tokens in `src/core/theme/tokens.css`.
4. **Vitest coverage gate** — domain layer targets 85% before Phase 3 ships.
5. **Playwright every 4–8 increments** — not every build; catch regressions at phase boundaries.
6. **DECISIONS.md is immutable** — append only. Once logged, an ADR is never edited.
7. **Mock data lives outside `/src`** — seed scripts in `/scripts/seed/`, never imported by production code.
8. **Cloudflare Pages** — not Netlify. Branch previews on every PR.
9. **Retro every 5 builds or 3 active dev days** — whichever comes first.

---

### Phase 0 — Foundation (current)

**Goal:** Working Vite app deployed to Cloudflare Pages. Design tokens. CI pipeline.

| # | Task | Done |
|---|---|---|
| 0.1 | `npm create vite@latest` — React + TypeScript | ✅ |
| 0.2 | ESLint + Prettier config | ✅ |
| 0.3 | Vitest + React Testing Library (39 tests passing) | ✅ |
| 0.4 | CSS custom properties from `tokens.jsx` → `tokens.css` | ✅ |
| 0.5 | Google Fonts (Fredoka + Nunito) in `index.html` | ✅ |
| 0.6 | PWA manifest + base service worker (Vite PWA plugin) | ✅ |
| 0.7 | Cloudflare Pages project + wrangler config | ✅ (config done; deploy on first push) |
| 0.8 | GitHub Actions: lint → test → deploy on push | ✅ |
| 0.9 | Build number injected at build time (`VITE_BUILD_NUMBER`) | ✅ |
| 0.10 | `CHANGELOG.md` entry `2026.05.23.2` | ✅ |

**Exit criteria:** `npm run dev` shows blank app with correct fonts and palette. `npm run build` deploys to Cloudflare Pages URL.

---

### Phase 1 — Domain Layer ✅

**Goal:** All domain types, invariants, and pure functions. No UI. High test coverage.

| # | Task | Done |
|---|---|---|
| 1.1 | Types: `ChildProfile`, `TaskTemplate`, `TaskSchedule`, `TaskInstance`, `PointsEvent`, `Reward` | ✅ |
| 1.2 | Points engine: `currentPoints(events)`, `lifetimeXp(events)`, `level(xp)` | ✅ |
| 1.3 | Task state machine: `resolveTaskState(instance, now)` | ✅ |
| 1.4 | Task instance generator: `generateInstances(template, schedule, dates, existing, now)` | ✅ |
| 1.5 | Streak calculator: `calculateStreak(instances, childId, today)` | ✅ |
| 1.6 | Demerit cap: `clampDemerit(amount)` → max −20 | ✅ |
| 1.7 | Drive file schema: `JitsuDriveFile` type + `validateDriveFile(raw)` | ✅ |
| 1.8 | Factory functions: `createProfile`, `createTaskTemplate`, `createFamilyFile`, etc. | ✅ |
| 1.9 | Vitest suite: 79 tests · 100% line/fn coverage · 95% branch | ✅ |

---

### Phase 2 — Storage Layer ✅

**Goal:** IndexedDB schema + Drive client. App works offline and syncs silently.

| # | Task | Done |
|---|---|---|
| 2.1 | IndexedDB schema via `idb` — 9 stores, compound indexes | ✅ |
| 2.2 | Typed query helpers per store (`db.profiles`, `db.taskInstances`, etc.) | ✅ |
| 2.3 | Google OAuth 2.0 via GIS — sign-in, silent refresh, token storage + Zustand store | ✅ |
| 2.4 | Google Drive REST API v3 client — find/create folder, read/write file | ✅ |
| 2.5 | Sync engine — pull if Drive newer, push debounced 2s, offline detection | ✅ |
| 2.6 | `useSync()` hook — status / lastSyncedAt / triggerSync | ✅ |
| 2.7 | Family join code | ✅ (Phase 1) |
| 2.8 | `seedFromDriveFile()` — Drive pull → IndexedDB (upsert + orphan delete) | ✅ |
| 2.9 | `serializeToFile()` — IndexedDB → JitsuDriveFile for push | ✅ |

---

### Phase 3 — Child Experience

**Goal:** Full child UX — profile picker → tasks → celebrate → rewards. Pixel-perfect against prototype.

| # | Task | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 3.1 | Design system components: `ChunkyButton`, `Card`, `TabBar`, `PointsBadge` | ✅ |
| 3.2 | Profile picker screen | ✅ |
| 3.3 | Home screen + task list (locked / available / completed / missed states) | ✅ |
| 3.4 | Task detail + complete flow | ✅ |
| 3.5 | Confetti + points animation celebration overlay | ✅ |
| 3.6 | Level-up overlay | ✅ |
| 3.7 | Rewards vault + redemption flow | ✅ |
| 3.8 | Streak screen | ✅ |
| 3.9 | Trophy wall (achievements placeholder) | ✅ |
| 3.10 | Jitsu mascot — CSS placeholder until Rive file ready | ✅ |
| 3.11 | Playwright smoke tests: complete task, redeem reward | ⬜ deferred to Phase 7 |

---

### Phase 4 — Parent Experience ✅

**Goal:** Full parent mode — task creation, rewards, bonus/demerit composers.

| # | Task | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 4.1 | Parent dashboard | ✅ |
| 4.2 | Task form: name, points, schedule slots, reminder times | ✅ |
| 4.3 | Manage rewards: create / edit / toggle | ✅ |
| 4.4 | Manage kids: create / edit profiles, avatar picker | ✅ |
| 4.5 | Bonus composer → triggers excitement popup on child's session | ✅ |
| 4.6 | Demerit composer (capped −20) → triggers calm correction popup | ✅ |
| 4.7 | Bonus / demerit overlay on child side | ✅ |

---

### Phase 5 — Onboarding ✅

**Goal:** First-run setup and multi-device join flow.

| # | Task | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 5.1 | Welcome screen — "Set up our family" vs "Join our family" | ✅ |
| 5.2 | Google Sign-In screen (FamilySetup, step 1) | ✅ |
| 5.3 | Family name + first child profile entry | ✅ |
| 5.4 | Join code display and clipboard copy | ✅ |
| 5.5 | Join flow — enter code → Google sign-in → sync | ✅ |
| 5.6 | "Reconnect Drive" prompt (parent mode, token expired) | ✅ |
| 5.7 | Playwright: full onboarding flow | ⬜ deferred to Phase 7 |

---

### Phase 6 — Notifications ✅

**Goal:** Local task reminders. Contextual permission request.

| # | Task | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 6.1 | Notification scheduling module (`core/notifications/index.ts`) — `setTimeout`-based, delegates display to SW | ✅ |
| 6.2 | Permission request tied to first task save with a reminder time (contextual, parent only) | ✅ |
| 6.3 | Re-schedule all notifications on app open and foreground resume (post-reboot recovery) | ✅ |
| 6.4 | iOS install prompt: `IOSInstallBanner` — shown to Safari users; guides "Add to Home Screen" | ✅ |

---

### Phase 7 — Polish & Launch ✅

**Goal:** Production-ready. Audio. Theme switcher. Install prompts. Tests. Security review.

| # | Task | Status |
|---|---|---|
| 7.1 | Mascot CSS enhanced — all 5 moods animated (`happy`, `cheer`, `wow`, `calm`, `sleep`) | ✅ |
| 7.2 | Web Audio API — synthesized sounds for task complete, level-up, reward redemption | ✅ |
| 7.3 | Theme switcher UI in Parent Dashboard — 4 swatches, applies + persists immediately | ✅ |
| 7.4 | PWA install prompts — `AndroidInstallBanner` (`beforeinstallprompt`) + `IOSInstallBanner` (Phase 6) | ✅ |
| 7.5 | Playwright E2E — config, 3 suites, 13 tests (smoke, child flow, parent flow) | ✅ |
| 7.6 | Lighthouse audit | ⬜ Run post-deploy against Cloudflare Pages URL |
| 7.7 | Security review | ✅ ADR-015 logged — no blockers |
| 7.8 | Retro + DECISIONS.md — ADR-013 (notifications), ADR-014 (audio), ADR-015 (security) | ✅ |
| — | **Rive mascot integration** — blocked on `.riv` designer asset; CSS placeholder in place | 🎨 Pending asset |
